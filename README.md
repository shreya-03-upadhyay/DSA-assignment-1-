# DSA-assignment-1- Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of core data structure and algorithm concepts using
Python. The project demonstrates Stack ADT, recursion, and algorithmic logic.
Implemented Components
Part A: Stack ADT
A Stack Abstract Data Type with the following operations:
push(x), pop(), peek(), is_empty()
The program provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
Part B: Factorial & Fibonacci (Recursion)
Factorial: Recursive implementation, valid for n ≥ 0, handles invalid input.
Fibonacci: Recursive implementation, prints the first 20 Fibonacci numbers.
Part C: Recursive Binary Search
Uses recursion to search an element in a sorted array.
Returns the index if found, otherwise prints "Element not found".
